Warning. The 

TL:DR; The code is crap because the framework is still under heavy development.

Ideas come and go. Some are outlined, some prototyped, some even fully implemented. Most of them stick around and wait for polishing. `test/` directory is a melting pot of ideas of components, whereas examples `demos/` present how it could all works together in an actual app.

The examples are written more or less ugly, with a lot of inline styles and !important rules. That's because they are usually a quickly-put-together proof of concept and the `demos/` and `test/` files are in various stages of implementation or experimentation.
